	<h1>Armed Forces culture must change</h1>

	Serving in the military is by definition a dangerous occupation. The possibility of being seriously injured or even killed can be minimised but can never be entirely eliminated.

	<p>However, like any other employer, the MoD does have an obligation to reduce the risk to its staff of being injured either physically or psychologically.</p>

	<p>That obligation extends to how it treats recruits. The first inquest into the death of Pte Cheryl James at Deepcut Barracks in 1995 lasted just one day.  At the re-convened inquest, Coroner Brian Barker QC delivered a verdict last month after an investigation that lasted several weeks and heard evidence from 109 witnesses.  The Coroner criticised the first investigation into Pte James’ death, but he also concluded that the death was suicide.</p>

	<p>However, a great deal of his lengthy verdict was devoted to criticism of the army’s failure in its duty of care towards these young recruits.  In addition to Pte Cheryl James there were three other similar deaths at Deepcut army barracks between 1995 and 2002:  Pte Sean Benton (20) Pte Geoff Gray (17) and Pte James Collison (17). Each was found with fatal gunshot wounds.</p>

	<p>The Coroner described an anarchic, highly sexualised, alcohol-fuelled regime at Deepcut where bullying, harassment and humiliation were standard operating procedure.  It was into this toxic environment that Cheryl James and other teenage recruits, most away from home for the first time, were plunged.</p>

	<p>Staff shortages meant Deepcut’s ratio of corporals to trainees was unacceptably low.  Supervision was lax and although up to one third of the 500 trainees were women, there were just two female officers, both away at the time of Pte James’s death.</p>

	<p>Drunken parties in empty accommodation blocks were, it emerged, part of the camp’s social life.  One witness described Deepcut as being ‘out of control’ saying every evening was like ‘Glasgow or London on a Saturday night’.</p>

	<p>The scale of <a href="#nogo">bullying</a> and inappropriate sexual behaviour at Deepcut revealed at the inquest is borne out by allegations made to Surrey police. By 1995, there had been 80 allegations of indecent assault.  A further 38 allegations made between 2001 and 2002 included two of rape.</p>

	<p>Brig John Donnelly, the army’s head of personnel services, agreed at the inquest that the atmosphere at Deepcut was ‘highly sexualised’. The MoD has since acknowledged that there was no effective channel for complaints against instructors and the system for raising concerns about bullying was ‘of limited effectiveness’.</p>

	<p>The army is changing, restructuring and reducing its numbers. Both sexes and all ages are being trained together.  There is even talk of female soldiers being permitted to take part in combat operations. The culture of the armed forces (the army in particular) also needs to change, but the pace of that change is perhaps not as fast as it should be.  There are still instances of assault, bullying, or harassment, usually fuelled by alcohol excess, that lead to mental health issues, bodily harm or serious injury.</p>

	<p>Of course there is a need to make training tough and realistic to prepare people for what might come on the battlefield but the MoD must, like any other employer, take effective measures to ensure the safety and well-being of its staff.  A soldier is just as likely to suffer personal injury in a road traffic accident or an accident at work as any civilian and, just like any employer in civvy street, the MoD has a duty to minimise those risks.</p>

	<p>However, it has long been accepted that bullying, harassment and assault are utterly unacceptable in any workplace, including the armed forces. That means the MoD should not only take steps to avoid injuries due to negligent practice, but must also prevent systemic failures that could ‘condone’ a culture which tolerates such abuses.</p>

	<p>Serving military personnel who have suffered assault or bullying may be reluctant to take legal action simply because they are unaware that they can make a claim. No matter who the perpetrators of these assaults and bullying might have been, whether NCOs, private soldiers or officers, we can give advice and assistance and fight your corner since the MoD cannot evade its duty of care towards you.</p>

	<p>If they have been negligent in that duty you are fully entitled to make a claim for compensation.  Arguably, only by more victims doing so will the lessons be learned and the culture of the armed forces begin to change.</p>
